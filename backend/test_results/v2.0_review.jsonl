The Elastic Search AI Platform, used by more than 50% of the Fortune 500, brings together the precision of search and the intelligence of AI to enable everyone to accelerate the results that matter. By taking advantage of all structured and unstructured data — securing and protecting private information more effectively — Elastic’s complete, cloud-based solutions for search, security, and observability help organizations deliver on the promise of AI.\n\n### What Is The Role\nEngineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that you should be empowered to comment on really anything, regardless of your role within the company.\n\nRight now, we are on the lookout for a talented Java Engineer to join our Elasticsearch opex team and focus on understanding Elasticsearch performance, optimization, and best practices for the production environment. You can be based (pretty much) anywhere in the world.\n\n### What You Will Be Doing\n- Designing and implementing new horizontally scalable features and APIs in our product\n- Optimizing internal data structures used to understand Elasticsearch under the hood\n- Create new workflow pipeline\n- Tackling difficult issues, including performance or concurrency issues, and proposing solutions\n- Collaborating in the open with the Elasticsearch team, Elastic support engineers, and others\n- Make our customers and our support engineers greater\n\n### What You Bring\n- Strong on Java in general, including concurrency concepts and the standard library of data structures\n- Willingness to dive into new issues and ask for help when you need it\n- Experience deploying and operationalizing software in production\n- Experience leading projects involving multiple engineers\n- Ability to plan, design, implement and lead projects independently\n- Experience with the ELK stack\n- Basic knowledge in any relational database with a preference to Postgres\n- Good communication skills\n\n### Bonus Points\n- Knowledge in GO\n- Experience with Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes\n\n### Additional Information\nAs a distributed company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.\n\nWe strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.\n- Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary\n- Health coverage for you and your family in many locations\n- Ability to craft your calendar with flexible locations and schedules for many roles\n- Generous number of vacation days each year\n- Increase your impact - We match up to $2000 (or local currency equivalent) for financial donations and service\n- Up to 40 hours each year to use toward volunteer projects you love\n- Embracing parenthood with a minimum of 16 weeks of parental leave\n\nDifferent people approach problems differently.

It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that you should be empowered to comment on really anything, regardless of your role within the company.\n\nRight now, we are on the lookout for a talented Java Engineer to join our Elasticsearch opex team and focus on understanding Elasticsearch performance, optimization, and best practices for the production environment. You can be based (pretty much) anywhere in the world.\n\n### What You Will Be Doing\n- Designing and implementing new horizontally scalable features and APIs in our product\n- Optimizing internal data structures used to understand Elasticsearch under the hood\n- Create new workflow pipeline\n- Tackling difficult issues, including performance or concurrency issues, and proposing solutions\n- Collaborating in the open with the Elasticsearch team, Elastic support engineers, and others\n- Make our customers and our support engineers greater\n\n### What You Bring\n- Strong on Java in general, including concurrency concepts and the standard library of data structures\n- Willingness to dive into new issues and ask for help when you need it\n- Experience deploying and operationalizing software in production\n- Experience leading projects involving multiple engineers\n- Ability to plan, design, implement and lead projects independently\n- Experience with the ELK stack\n- Basic knowledge in any relational database with a preference to Postgres\n- Good communication skills\n\n### Bonus Points\n- Knowledge in GO\n- Experience with Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes\n\n### Additional Information\nAs a distributed company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.\n\nWe strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.\n- Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary\n- Health coverage for you and your family in many locations\n- Ability to craft your calendar with flexible locations and schedules for many roles\n- Generous number of vacation days each year\n- Increase your impact - We match up to $2000 (or local currency equivalent) for financial donations and service\n- Up to 40 hours each year to use toward volunteer projects you love\n- Embracing parenthood with a minimum of 16 weeks of parental leave\n\nDifferent people approach problems differently.

We feel that you should be empowered to comment on really anything, regardless of your role within the company.\n\nRight now, we are on the lookout for a talented Java Engineer to join our Elasticsearch opex team and focus on understanding Elasticsearch performance, optimization, and best practices for the production environment. You can be based (pretty much) anywhere in the world.\n\n### What You Will Be Doing\n- Designing and implementing new horizontally scalable features and APIs in our product\n- Optimizing internal data structures used to understand Elasticsearch under the hood\n- Create new workflow pipeline\n- Tackling difficult issues, including performance or concurrency issues, and proposing solutions\n- Collaborating in the open with the Elasticsearch team, Elastic support engineers, and others\n- Make our customers and our support engineers greater\n\n### What You Bring\n- Strong on Java in general, including concurrency concepts and the standard library of data structures\n- Willingness to dive into new issues and ask for help when you need it\n- Experience deploying and operationalizing software in production\n- Experience leading projects involving multiple engineers\n- Ability to plan, design, implement and lead projects independently\n- Experience with the ELK stack\n- Basic knowledge in any relational database with a preference to Postgres\n- Good communication skills\n\n### Bonus Points\n- Knowledge in GO\n- Experience with Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes\n\n### Additional Information\nAs a distributed company, diversity drives our identity. Whether you’re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesn’t matter if you’re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.\n\nWe strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.\n- Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary\n- Health coverage for you and your family in many locations\n- Ability to craft your calendar with flexible locations and schedules for many roles\n- Generous number of vacation days each year\n- Increase your impact - We match up to $2000 (or local currency equivalent) for financial donations and service\n- Up to 40 hours each year to use toward volunteer projects you love\n- Embracing parenthood with a minimum of 16 weeks of parental leave\n\nDifferent people approach problems differently.
